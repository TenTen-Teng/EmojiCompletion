Exactly! There are times where I feel like a super creep for posting so much.But that could also be my brain being over analyzing things 
Jokes aside, being fan of an actor & showing your love for their work is different from stalking them. So I wouldn't consider you a creep. 
Don't thank me, I'm just pointing out the obvious. But I'm glad that I made someone (you) feel better today. So I guess that's my reward.

I’m saying the society likes Bella i don’t care about her

To say something isn’t racist or sexist because it’s true is the go to argument for bigots 
Lmfao nah it’s all good 
At least my profile pic is me lol 
 I'm not tryna fail lmao I just might delete the first tweet cuz I still got notis from that and Im just tryna chill now that I got my shit done. Especialy the other faggorito tryna talk shit for no reason I looked through his tweets and the man just chasing attention

Pistons didn’t beat Jordan in the finals 
I don’t know a single person who thought KD couldn’t hold his own 
Lol don't act like thunder don't use Roberson to guard the best perimeter player. And you're so scared of curry you double team him all the time

I LOVE THAT GUY!!!!!!  I can so relate!  I also love the guy who grabs his glasses and suddenly puts them on like "NO WAY!!! Is that who I think it is???"  
That guy in the middle didn’t even know he was 
How big 
That's up to them. I think they're fine just the way they are. Marriage doesn't make you love someone anymore than you already do. Although, I would love to see that.

Jake Paul just always does stupid shit.

But you guys Lost 
Heck ya! Don't have to use Subway Gift Cards anymore

I dont care what anyone says this joke was pure gold
Adding responsive dead body movement was possibly the greatest thing over created 
Nothing will beat it, the closest thing is the first flood encounter on 343 guilty spark. Scared the shit outa me 
You got to be kidding me , this was obviously a joke . The fact that you posted it as a reply not once but Twice , Makes you the joke 
Right! Does he do the same shit to kids watching a puppet show? It's not real! 
You don't have a clue Ted
 I’m out of touch cos I don’t watch wrestling!!! Good one! Please tell me more of these predetermined sports that you watch.
 All aspects of pro wrestling are fake! The only part that is real are the injuries and even that is questionable at times. If you think a multi billion $ business will leave anything to chance then you are the idiot! Everything you see is planned & coordinated. Simples!
hehe jim carrey i love you 
Just take my money now 
what a shocker, let's live in the place which is one of the few places in world that are called cities/countries from future. & then give opinion based on these places about countries that oppress women. standing ovation lady.

There’s no point wasting your time hating when your not going to change anything babes 
I don’t have £50 to splash around 
So we’re completely ignoring contractual obligations here? Like we’re just totally throwing the legal stuff out the window because you think she could have easily disagreed? 
Lol what money 
I agree the items are not worth £50 and I would never pay it, and I am also not a fan girl 
Boots have shown how willing they are to change prices by the fact it's half the price now! If some fan reviews have the ability to get the price slashed in half I think the mighty Zoella whose product it BELONGS TO could've changed the price if she wanted! 
Yet you’re only calling her out on it 
 when did I say you weren’t entitled to your opinion? I am also entitled to mine 
Yes she could have done it before yesterday, but when she's worked hard on something she thought everyone would like for it to be ruined by retailers, do you really think she's over the moon at the minute? 
How has she lied 
She doesn't have rights to it anymore, are you joking me 
I got my eyes on u 
Convo been over 
Right fam! Lmao this dude confused af talm bout its a concert and too loud to stand up for yourself

Right!! Lmao for a simple ass tweet 
Aye I give you that no doubt, but lets be real here if anything its gonna be a dude shooting the place up. Not taking is sexual tension out on a girl who rejected him 
I am very humble 
Just drop it , you females love arguing 
Why do you want attention?
