Your support and visit are so greatly appreciated! 
I pray you quit overthinking, replaying failed scenarios, feeding self-doubt and seeing the good in everyone but yourself. You deserve more. 
You throw away who you really are by following expectations held by other people who want you to be 'this kind of person'. If you are not living your life for yourself, then who is going to live it for you?
We don't always have to agree with one another but it's important that we learn to respect each other 
The quickest way to start not liking yourself is to focus too much on your shortcomings instead of your strong points. 
Early morning thought : When we control people, we are robbing them and ourselves of natural victories and setbacks in life. We want them to do things "our way" but are we truly sure that "our way" is the best? 
The person you will be in 5 years depends largely on the information you feed your mind today. 
Nothing blooms all year round...be patient with yourself 
God's will always happens at the right time, at the time God wants it to happen. Good morning twitterlandia

We should speak out truth. It is okay to confront. But confrontation with expectation is manipulation. 
The shortest route to unhappiness is to make comparisons. You are okay just as you are. I hope you realize that..

Such a great story from Carolina, a doctor with the Italian Mobile Health ERU who until mom returned, didn’t know if the baby had survived. Amazing job guys!  
It’s not easy to leave my children for a deployment, I miss them everyday. I hope they grow up knowing that there is a larger world outside of their own, that they understand the importance of helping others and that they contribute positively in whatever way they are able. 
On average, 12 UK men a day commit suicide. These 12 men want to stop that. Proud my twin brother James is one of them.
Stop saying yes to everything and everyone. Stop agreeing with people just so you don't upset them. You are not a pushover. You weren't put on this world to be stressed so others can be happy and relaxed. Protect yourself.
